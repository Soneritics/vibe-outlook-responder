# Privacy Policy

**AI Responder - Outlook Add-in**  
**Last Updated**: February 4, 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how AI Responder ("the Add-in"), developed by Jordi Jolink ("I", "me"), handles your information. I am committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about data practices.

## Data Collection and Access

### What the Add-in Accesses

The Add-in accesses the following data to provide its functionality:

1. **Email Content**: The Add-in reads email content (subject, body, sender information) when you request AI-generated responses. This content is processed only when you explicitly trigger a response generation.

2. **Your Prompts**: Custom prompts you create are stored to personalize your experience.

3. **Settings**: Your preferences including selected AI model, language settings, and other configuration options.

4. **OpenAI API Key**: Your API key is required to connect to OpenAI's services.

### What the Add-in Does NOT Collect

- I do not collect, store, or have access to your personal data on any external servers
- I do not track your usage patterns or behavior
- I do not collect analytics or telemetry data
- I do not have access to your email content - it is sent directly to OpenAI

## Data Usage

### How Your Data is Used

1. **Email Content**: When you select a prompt, the email content is sent directly from your device to OpenAI's API to generate a response. I do not have access to this content at any point.

2. **Prompts and Settings**: Your custom prompts and settings are used solely to provide the Add-in's functionality and are stored locally or in your Outlook account's roaming settings.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

The following data is stored locally on your device or in your Outlook account:

| Data Type      | Storage Location         | Synced Across Devices |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| API Key        | Local device only        | No (for security)     |
| Custom Prompts | Outlook roaming settings | Yes                   |
| Settings       | Outlook roaming settings | Yes                   |

### No External Storage

I do not operate any servers that store your data. All data remains either:

- On your local device
- In your Microsoft/Outlook account (roaming settings)
- Transmitted directly to OpenAI when you request generation

## Third-Party Services

### OpenAI

The Add-in integrates with OpenAI's API to generate email responses. When you use the generation feature:

- Email content and your prompt are sent to OpenAI
- OpenAI processes this data according to their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- OpenAI's [API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) apply

**Important**: By using this Add-in, you agree to OpenAI's terms and policies. I recommend reviewing OpenAI's privacy practices before using the Add-in.

### Microsoft

The Add-in runs within Microsoft Outlook and uses Microsoft's infrastructure:

- Roaming settings are stored via Microsoft's services
- Microsoft's privacy policies apply to data stored in Outlook

## Data Security

I implement the following security measures:

- **API Key Protection**: Your API key is stored locally and never transmitted to any server other than OpenAI
- **HTTPS/TLS Encryption**: All communications with OpenAI use encrypted connections
- **No Intermediary Servers**: Data flows directly from your device to OpenAI with no intermediary storage

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Delete Your Data

You have full control over your data:

1. **Delete Prompts**: Remove any prompt through the Add-in's interface
2. **Remove API Key**: Clear your API key from Settings at any time
3. **Uninstall**: Removing the Add-in will remove all locally stored data
4. **Clear Roaming Settings**: You can reset all synced data through the Add-in's Settings

### Opt-Out

You can stop using the Add-in at any time by:

1. Not triggering response generation
2. Removing your API key
3. Uninstalling the Add-in

## Children's Privacy

This Add-in is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Add-in after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
